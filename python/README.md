Python
=======

Various stand-alone Python scripts.

#### subtitler.py
This script fetches automatically subtitles from subscene.com and extracts them to the working directory. The search is made based on a text string in clipboard OR using the filename of a single video file in the same directory as the script.

#### telegram_irc_bridge
The script works as a bridging daemon between IRC and a Telegram group. Detected messages from a watched IRC channel are forwarded to Telegram and vice versa.
