=======

Various small Javascript projects.

#### spacegame.py
A small asteroid evasion arcade game. Both models, spaceship and asteroids, are modeled and textured by myself in Blender. The game world is rendered and logic implemented with P5.js. See a working demo in [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/pkronstrom/095cd4ab1c3a4a51c84982fd2bc650ee).

#### mazenator
Generates mazes using a depth-first based backtracking algorithm. See a working demo in [bl.ocks.org](https://bl.ocks.org/pkronstrom/308feae52c47818cf94493c330de8ebd).
